***The [TensorFlow Object Detection API]("https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection") is used as a base for object counting on this project, more info can be found on this [repo](https://github.com/nins15/Vehicle-speed-and-congestion-detector/tree/master/utils). Apart from that some code has also been based on this [site](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-use-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/)***

* Object slike car ,truck and person are detected using Tensorflow object detection api
* Speed is calculated for the last dtected object along with its directio
* If any two objects come too close to each other then "WARNING" is displayed to mark congestion
